# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer:    From my memory, object-oriented programming I know is used in the Ruby language. Everything in Ruby is objects. Functional programming seems to me to be more aligned with Javascript, and has more than just objects.

Researched answer:  Object-oriented programming (OOP)is organized around data and objects. This is very different from functions and logic that is used, for example, in Javascript. OOP, for short, has its advantages for programs that are much more complex, large, and consistently updated and maintained.

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: 

        The difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby is only defined by the decimal point. An integer is a whole number, numbers we commonly use in our day to day lives. Five, six, seven, one thousand. A Float is a number with a decimal. In Ruby these are called Floats. Although less common, these can be 0.01, 3.14, etc. Even though 1.000000000 is the same as just 1, it is a float.

Researched answer: 

        The difference is that an integer is a whole number and a float is just a number with a decimal. Float is short for "floating point value". These are only two of seven I discovered researching. A float seems like it can give the user a lot more accuracy when needed, rather than using a simple whole number. A float, due to its inherit length, may take up more storage than just a whole number.

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer:

         To the best of my current knowledge, implict return means that the value will be indefinetly returned. I don't think writting "return" is required in implicit return. I would be more comfortable providing you the correct answer if I had an opportunity to research this topic.

Researched answer:

        Implicit return in Ruby: Since Ruby is an object-oriented programming language, full of methods, every method provides a return. This is automatically done, returning the value of the last line in a block.

4. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer:

        A block in Ruby is where the method is getting instructions. I hesitate to use the word "function", simply because I understand Ruby is not a function and logic language.

Researched answer:

        These Ruby blocks inside of do & end statements, and within these, anonymous functions can be placed into methods. These are always between curly brackets "{}". Along with these rules, the arguments are placed within pipes "||".

1. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer:

         Extracting a value in a Ruby hash is very similar to extracting a value in a javascript object. I can provide a much clearer answer if you allow me to elaborate by doing some research into the exact tools needed to extract a value in a Ruby hash.

Researched answer:

        The best way to accomplish this is to call the specific ruby hash by its key name within the curly brackets. These are individually assigned using the hash rocket (=>). 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Class Inheritance: In Ruby, this allows the user to combine a class into another class, or to inherit.

2. RSpec: This is Ruby's very own testing software. This has been created for behavior-driven development. This is not the only Ruby testing library, but it is the most widely used and accepted.

3. CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete. This acronym is a model used commonly in creating web applications.

4. Test-driven development: This, also known as TDD, is the process in which to test code using a software library(Jest). This has many positive benefits including creating flawless code that can confidently be error proof, due to the TDD process.

5. HTTP: This stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, and is an application layer. HTTP is used for sending and transmitting hypermedia documents. Its primary design, is the purpose of communicating between web browsers and web servers.
